When I just started college the dot-com bubble burst. News anchors cautioned that there wouldn’t be any more web development work. Many of my class switched majors.

After I got my first job out of college Tom Friedman published “The World is Flat” which predicted that expensive American engineers wouldn’t survive when pitted against cheaper off-shore talent.

At my third industry job I was told to make thorough UML diagrams of all the company systems because a tool like Rational Rose would be able to generate the code instead of needing coders.

I was told drag and drop site builders would soon be so advanced all but the most specific use cases would be handled by them.

I was told Software as a Service would mean companies would stop building their internal tools and Salesforce would win.

I was told “no code” tools would be the preferred means of constructing new software.

I was told “low code” tools would solve all the problems with “no code”.

Now I’m being told that AI Agents will replace devs and we’ll never be needed again.

One day, they’ll be right.
